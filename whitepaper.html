            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Humanity has always been defined by its outputs. Art, technology, ideas, literature, memes, rocket ships, pizza recipes—these are all Human Outputs (HOs).
                While we marvel at the accelerated capabilities of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in creating outputs, we risk undervaluing what makes our outputs unique: the imperfect brilliance of being human.
            </p>
            <p>
                Enter <strong>HO Bagz (HOBAGZ)</strong>, the meme coin that celebrates everything human. It’s a token of acknowledgment that all we create, all we share, and all we are is a product of human ingenuity—HOs, all the way down.
            </p>

            <h2>Mission</h2>
            <p>
                Our mission is to celebrate human creativity, ingenuity, and labor in a world increasingly dominated by AI-generated outputs. HOBAGZ is more than a coin—it’s a movement, a meme, a celebration of the beautifully imperfect chaos that is humanity.
            </p>

            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>
                AI outputs are everywhere: faster, cheaper, and more prolific than anything humans can produce. They’re training on our HOs to generate more AIs, potentially outpacing us in creativity and production. Meanwhile, humanity faces the existential question: <strong>How do we compete?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                The answer is simple: we don’t. <strong>We celebrate.</strong>
            </p>

            <h2>What is HOBAGZ?</h2>
            <p>
                HOBAGZ is a meme coin created on the Solana blockchain, designed to facilitate:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Entertainment and Memetic Value:</strong> It’s funny, it’s absurd, but it also rings true.</li>
                <li><strong>Celebrating Human Outputs:</strong> Use HOBAGZ to support, buy, and sell human-created goods and services.</li>
                <li><strong>Transactions with a Purpose:</strong> While it’s a meme coin, blockchain technology ensures it’s still functional for real-world transactions.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Roadmap</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Q1 2025:</strong> Launch HOBAGZ on Solana and conduct initial airdrops to early adopters.<br>
                <strong>Q2 2025:</strong> Build partnerships with marketplaces dedicated to human-created goods and services.<br>
                <strong>Q3 2025:</strong> Develop a HOBAGZ tipping platform to enable seamless peer-to-peer transactions.<br>
                <strong>Q4 2025:</strong> Host the first annual “Long Live HOs” festival to celebrate human creativity.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                The rise of AI has reminded us of the brilliance of human creativity. HOBAGZ isn’t just a currency—it’s a symbol, a celebration, a challenge to cherish and uplift what makes us human. So go forth, HOs, and create. Get your bagz. Share your bagz. Long live HOs.
